# Simple Todo Api
As a primary front-end engineer, I wanted to revisit my back-end development skills by creating a very basic RESTful API for managing todo items with basic CRUD operations. 
The API stores todos in memory (no database).

The sole purpose of creating this basic api is to revisit Node and Express fundamentals as well as setting API endpoints in which I can expand down the line or utilize in other projects.

Still in porgress.
